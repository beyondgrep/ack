# What do we call the new general purpose ack?

Ack is too surprising to non-programmers.  There will be a less
surprising, more greplike tool that takes goodness from ack.  But
what do we call it?

Must be

* pronouncable
    * and monosyllabic
* easy to type
* three characters
    * four maaaaybe if it's super easy to type, say, like "akjf"
* relatively low Googling conflict
    * not already a word
* No conflict with existing [BSD ports](http://www.freebsd.org/ports/),
[Ubuntu packages](http://packages.ubuntu.com/) or [Fedora RPMs](http://rpm.pbone.net/).

* [acronymfinder.com](http://www.acronymfinder.com/) is handy for overloaded name conflicts.

# Favorites

kap -- easy type, same short A sound as ack, direct and unambiguous

kel -- another good K name

wij -- easy type, abbreviates to "Where In Jesus' name did I put..."

gus -- general unified search, don't like the name so much, though

glo -- Kinda grep-like, easy type, very pronouncable, could get confused with "glow"?

# Ideas

erg -- Relates to doing work. Downside is that it's all left-hand.

rst -- follows the standard of TCP flags like ack, pronounceable as "rist", easy to type, I don't like the lack of vowel.

xoa -- singularly mine, no conflicts, but not pronouncable.  "zoe-uh"?

bix -- easy to type, but always refers to Bix Beiderbecke, or Byte Information Exchange

bax -- easy type, my first dog, sounds ack-like, could sound like "backs" like "backups"
